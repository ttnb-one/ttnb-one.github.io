> Lift is short，Tities and Beers.

TTNB is one of the majority ordinary people living in C-Country. He only wants to thinks with his own brain, but somehow it is some kind of inappropriate behaviour here due to his majesty's hard working. Therefore an anonymous
blog must be setup.

Why TTNB? TTNB stands for Tities and Beer, the direct happiness of straight male, and also, it represents the soul of free and easy attitude towards the shitness of life.

If anonymousness is a must, why not make it fascinating.

Lift is short，Tities and Beers.
